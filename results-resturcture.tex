\section{Pilot Survey and Focus Group}

\subsection{Pilot Survey Results}
As mentioned previously, the pilot survey was conducted using 14 subjects who were classed as highly aware of sea level extremes. The results from the pilot survey and focus group were used to improve the data collection design of the main survey. Figure 5.1 displays the results from the determination of awareness conducted on the pilot subjects.
\paragraph{}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/pilot-survey-results.png}
    \caption{Pilot Survey Results - The answers corresponding with \cite{kartverket_se_2020} model were always B, here coloured orange.   The majority chose answer B for question "which image display's Brattøra's 20-year storm surge now?". However for "Which image display's Brattøra's 20-year storm surge in 2090?" the majority chose C, with D the next popular answer. For "Which image displays Brattøra's high tide?" the responses were widely spread, with B being the least popular, even though it matched the model from \cite{kartverket_se_2020}.    }
    \label{fig:pilot_survey_results}
\end{figure}

The pilot survey subjects did not readily select the predicted answers for sea level extremes in Trondheim. The answer which corresponds with the model from \cite{kartverket_se_2020}, for each of the questions is B, which is represented in orange in figure 5.1. The responses for the question of the high tide were widely spread, with the answer corresponding with the model from \cite{kartverket_se_2020} being the least popular.  Answer C was the most popular when responding about the 20 year storm surge in 2090. In contrast, the majority of subjects did chose the answer which corresponds with the model when being asked about where the current 20 year storm surge is. The number of answers which did not corresponded with \cite{kartverket_se_2020} models was of concern, due to the assumed high awareness of sea level extremes in the subjects. For this reason a focus group was conducted. 
\paragraph{}


\subsection{Focus Group Results}
  The focus group suggested that the maps looked too similar, especially when using smart phones. It was difficult to tell the maps apart due to the relatively small changes. This was particularly the case for the question about the high tide. Furthermore, several participants highlighted that they did not think of sea level extremes in terms of area flooded, but solely in terms of changing height. This one dimensional view was highlighted as a limiting factor in the understanding of potential impacts. 
\paragraph{}

The focus group was shown Figure 5.2. They were then asked which visualisation would more easily help them answer the questions set in the pilot survey.
\paragraph{}


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{fig_results/slide-pilot-survey.png}
    \caption{Slide shown to the focus group. The first image is how sea level extremes could be visualised using maps of the area. The second image is how sea level extremes could be visualised using photo editing of the waterline. The third image is how the sea level extremes could be visualised in a numeric way. This slide was used to spark discussion and allow for comparison.}
    \label{fig:slide}
\end{figure}

Several of the participants chose numeric value visualisation, but recognised that was likely due to their professional background. Those with a longer knowledge of Trondheim favoured the simulated sea level extremes pictures. This was also highlighted as the option with the highest emotional impact and the visualisation which caught the whole focus groups attention.

\paragraph{}

The results of the focus group and pilot survey were that this method was reasonable for determining awareness, but that a combination of numerical and image based visualisation of sea level extremes would be more useful, rather than map based. This decision did lose the spatial aspect of communication, but allowed for greater emotional connection.

\section{Technological Systems Resilience}

Distinguishing technological and natural systems can be difficult in a landscape which has been actively shaped by its population for so long. For Trondheim, the location of infrastructure including buildings and roads is the primary focus of the technological system which impacts resilience to sea level extremes. How this infrastructure is built is of course of great importance to whether a speedy return to normality is possible after a sea level extreme event. Norway has strict building regulations, with further rules about infrastructure in vulnerable locations (\cite{direktoratet_for_byggkvalitet_direktoratet_nodate}). Yet even very well designed infrastructure will still be impacted if flooded. Impacts range from the obvious  prevention of use during flooding, to post event clean up and the wear and damage which can occur from sea level extreme events.
\paragraph{}
Table 5.1 displays the number of building which are likely to be impacted during different sea level extremes in Trondheim. This is modelled by \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and was the base of later water level simulations as used in this project. Importantly, this modelling is more localised than previous models of sea level extremes in Norway.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
        \textbf{Water Level }& \textbf{No. Buildings}  & ~ & ~ & ~ \\ \hline

        3m sea level rise & 584 & 285 & 55 & 3 \\ \hline
        4m sea level rise & 752 & 335 & 70 & 5 \\ \hline
        5m sea level rise & 1023 & 402 & 77 & 8 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Impact of Sea Level Extremes to Buildings in Trondheim translated from \cite{kartverket_se_2021} - The major contrast between current 20 year storm surge and the 2090, 20 year storm surge is that at the water level is high enough to flood a critical building. Flooding of a critical building would also occur at 2m sea level rise.}
    \label{building-impact-sle}
\end{table}


Table 5.1 shows that there is currently some risk from sea level extremes. The current 20 year return height is projected to cause the flooding of 247 buildings. However, it is worth noting that in 2022 no critical buildings are predicted to flood even with the 1000 year return height. This is in contrast to the 20 year return height in 2090, which is projected to cause the flooding of one critical building.
\paragraph{}

Norway's economy and residency patterns are very dependent on infrastructure along the coast (\cite{aunan_strong_2008}). As seen in Table 5.1, Trondheim also has some dependency on coastal infrastructure. The information here will be used to discuss Trondheim's technological resilience to sea level extremes in the discussion. 


\section{Natural Systems Resilience}
The natural system resilience focused upon in this section is that which is impacted by the changing water levels expected with different see level extremes. The results are predominately figures created from analysis of several  data-sets including: \cite{geonorge_stormflo_nodate} , \cite{kartverket_se_2021}, \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021} and \cite{ipcc_sea_2021}

\subsection{Visual Simulation of Sea Level Extremes}
 Figures 5.3 to 5.6 display the simulated sea level extremes created for this project based off \cite{kartverket_se_2020}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_sle/nidelva 2090 q.png}
    \caption{Simulated Sea Level Extremes for Nidelva research site - These were created using \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}. }
    \label{fig:SLE-nidelva}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_sle/brattora 2090 q.png}
    \caption{Simulated Sea Level Extremes for Brattøra research site - These were created using \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}. }
    \label{fig:SLE-brattora}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_sle/grillstad 2090 q.png}
    \caption{Simulated Sea Level Extremes for Grillstad research site - These were created using \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}. }
    \label{fig:SLE-grillstad}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_sle/illsvika 2090 q.png}
    \caption{Simulated Sea Level Extremes for Skansen research site - These were created using \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}. }
    \label{fig:sle-skansen}
\end{figure}


These Figures (5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6) display the sea level extremes simulated using edited photographs based off \cite{kartverket_se_2020}. The differing heights represent different potential events. 1.2m is a very likely event as this is the height associated with the spring high tide for each of the research sites. 2.2m is a lot less likely as it represents the water level height associated with the current 20 year storm surge, while a water level of 2.7m is projected for the 20 year storm surge in 2090. Finally, the 1000 year storm surge in 2090 is represented by 3.0m as seen in the bottom right of each of the figures.
\paragraph{}
The changing sea level extremes are not that significant in terms of height. Due to the geological setting discussed in the background, the natural systems resilience is high. However, the figures above also display how this interplays with technological and social system resilience, changing the ability to quickly return to normality depending on the water level. 


\subsection{Maps of Sea Level Extremes}
Figures 5.7 to 5.10 display the mapped sea level extremes created for this project based off \cite{kartverket_se_2020} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_sle/skansen-sle-num.png}
    \caption{Projected Sea Level Extremes for Skansen research site - These were created using \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}. }
    \label{fig:sle-skansen-num}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_sle/brattora-sle-num.png}
    \caption{Projected Sea Level Extremes for Brattøra research site - These were created using \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}. }
    \label{fig:sle-brattora-num}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_sle/grillstad-sle-num.png}
    \caption{Projected Sea Level Extremes for Skansen research site - These were created using \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}. }
    \label{fig:sle-grillstad-num}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_sle/nidelva-sle-num.png}
    \caption{Projected Sea Level Extremes for Skansen research site - These were created using \cite{kartverket_se_2021} and \cite{stormflo_database_stormflo_2021}. }
    \label{fig:sle-nidelva-num}
\end{figure}

These Figures (5.7, 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10) display the sea level extremes mapped for this project based off \cite{kartverket_se_2020}. Bridges were not well included in the original models: all bridges being flooded at every sea level extreme. The bridges in these maps have been adjusted to match the sea level extreme represented elsewhere in the map. The differing heights represent different potential events. 1.2m is a very likely event as this is the height associated with the spring high tide for each of the research sites. 2.2m is a lot less likely as it represents the water level height associated with the current 20 year storm surge, while a water level of 2.7m is projected for the 20 year storm surge in 2090. Finally, the 1000 year storm surge in 2090 is represented by 3.0m as seen in the bottom right of each of the figures. 

\section{Social Systems}

This section focuses on the results gained from the survey conducted to determine social resilience to sea level extremes in Trondheim.  It also includes the results from Kruskal Wallis Rank Sum Tests and Shapiro Tests. Each of the results gained from the survey questions is displayed in a graph. These results will be discussed later to determine Trondheim's social systems resilience to sea level extremes. The tables and graphs in the following section make reference to the main research survey questions. The full survey, in either Norwegian or English, is available in the appendix. Reference in the text is only made to the English questions. 



\subsection{Place and language}
Table 5.2 shows the by place split of the 153 subjects who completed the main survey. 
\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Place}  & \textbf{No. Subjects}  \\ \hline
      Skansen   & 29    \\ \hline
      Nidelva & 57      \\ \hline
      Grillstad & 37       \\ \hline
      Brattøra & 30     \\ \hline
      Total & 153   \\ \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \caption{Place subjects chose to Answer on. The most popular sub-survey was Nidelva with 57 responses, representing 37 percent of responses. Next popular was Grillstad with 37 responses and then Brattøra with 30 and Skansen with 29 respectively. The reasonable spread of response does allow for comparison}
    \label{tab:place}
\end{table}
\paragraph{}

As can be seen in the table above the most popular place for responses was Nidelva. This is the most central of the locations and has the greatest daily throughput of people. It also includes perhaps the most iconic views of Trondheim. Next popular was Grillstad, perhaps due to the recognition by residents that the area could be severely influenced by flooding from sea level extremes. Skansen and Brattøra are the next most responded to, both of these locations have significant commercial ventures. Brattøra in particular is dominated not by residency but by offices and industry. Perhaps the conduction of this survey in Summer decreased the number of responses due to the lack of office workers. Almost evenly split for each location was whether the survey was completed in Norwegian or English. English surveys had 66 response, while the Norwegian survey had 87 responses.  

\subsection{Interest Level in Sea Level Extremes}
Awareness as a facet of local knowledge was the key variable within this project. The purpose of the survey was to allow for the determination of awareness in Trondheim of sea level extremes. An interesting comparison is the level of interest against awareness. There is the assumption that high or professional interest in sea level extremes is associated with higher levels of awareness of the risk. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/interest-level.png}
    \caption{Interest Level in Sea Level Extremes - There is a good spread in the results to this question. Responses include that subjects have low interest (22 responses) or are not interested (7 responses) in sea level extremes. Almost half of the subjects (71/153) answered that they have a medium interest in sea level extremes. Unsurprisingly, more subjects answered that they had a high level of interest (40) than have a low level of interest in sea level extremes. 12 subjects answered that they have professional interest in sea level extremes. }
    \label{fig:my_interest_level}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}

The majority of subjects answered that their interest in sea level is medium. Only 7 subjects responded that they have no interest, however considering that there was no obligation to take part in this research on sea level extremes, that is a positive sign of the methods used to reach out to potential participants. 12 subjects responded that they have a professional interest in sea level extremes. Figure 5.8 below displays awareness against interest level.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/aware_vs_interest.png}
    \caption{Determined Awareness Against Interest Level -  Professional interest is level 5 on the y-axis, High  is level 4, medium is level 3, 2 is low interest and 1 is not interested. Subjects who responded high levels of interest are determined as representing all levels of awareness.}
    \label{fig:aware_vs_interest}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}

There is no linearity or other pattern observed in Figure 5.12. This raises questions about the assumption of resilience due to the presence of professionals within a community. However, there is a serious limitation: no marine workers were identified in the survey subjects. Subjects who ranked their interest in sea level as high (4) had the largest variation in determined awareness according to the number of answers they gave which matched models from \cite{kartverket_se_2020}. Medium level self ranking of interest has almost as broad a variation as high level, but does not include any subjects who were determined to have the highest level of awareness. It is worth noting  that Figure 5.12 does not display how often subjects interest level matched their awareness. A single subject is enough for a blue dot to be displayed as there is no weighting with this Figure, though this can be inferred from figure 5.11. 



\subsection{Memory of Sea Level Extremes}
How memory is formed and how it impacts awareness and resilience is a highly debated field \cite{de_guttry_expiry_2022}. The spread of the memory of sea level extreme events in Trondheim by the subjects is shown in figure 5.13.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/memory-sle.png}
    \caption{Memory of Sea Level Extremes - The subjects were asked which about each sea level extreme event (water level higher than 2m) they remembered occurring between 1950 and summer 2022. For the full list of potential events please consults the relevant question in the appendix. 45 out of 153 subjects do not remember any sea level extreme event in Trondheim. Only one subject remembered every sea level extreme event dating back to 1950 in Trondheim. 51 subjects remembered the sea level extreme event in February 2020. }
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}

As can be seen in figure 5.13  this is a very skewed factor. 30 percent of subjects have no memory of sea level extremes in Trondheim. Once that answer is excluded, there is an exponential increase in the number of subjects who remember the event as you get closer to the present. Relatively few subjects remembered sea level extremes. The lack of memory is very interesting considering that length of knowledge for 95 out of 153 subjects the majority included at least one sea level extreme events as can be seen in the figure below. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/long_know.png}
    \caption{Length of Knowledge of Subjects. 96 subjects had a length of knowledge about the place greater than 5 years 35 subjects had length of knowledge less than 5 years, but more than 1. Only 20 respondents had a length of knowledge under 1 year}
    \label{fig:long_know}
\end{figure}

Only 20 subjects responded that they had a length of knowledge of Trondheim under 1 year. 96 subjects responded that they had a length of knowledge greater than 5 years, which includes the sea level extreme event occurring in February 2020, which only 51 subjects remembered. The difference between a sea level extreme event and a disaster and how this impacts memory and resilience is expanded upon in the discussion.


\subsection{Information Access about Climate and Place}
There is significant skew in how subjects access information about climate and place as can be seen in Table 5.3 and Table 5.4 below. That individuals with a broader range of information sources have higher levels of awareness is one of the hypothesis as outlined in the introduction. 

\begin{center}

    \caption{Information about Climate Summary Statistics information access}
\label{table:summary_stats_info_access}
\end{table}
\end{center}

\begin{center}

         \end{tabular}
    \caption{Information about Place Summary Statistics information access}
\label{table:summary_stats_info_access}
\end{table}
\end{center}

This highly skewed responses with a large variation in mean and standard deviation impacts the type of hypothesis testing which could be carried out. 

\subsection{Community Membership}
Subjects were self-selecting stakeholders.  They were asked to identify themselves as members of communities that were highlighted by a stakeholder analysis. They were also given the choice to write in other community membership if they selected other. Figure 5.15 displays the community memberships selected by the subjects. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/com-mem-horizontal.png}
    \caption{Membership of Communities. There were 221 selections done by the 153 subjects. However many subjects only selected one community. The most selected community was resident, however only 70 out of 153 subjects - under h}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}

There are 70 subjects who answered that they are residents. This is the most common choice. Interestingly, very few subjects who answered they were students also selected a second community membership. Subjects who answered as other were either visitors, tourists or sailors. That subjects only ticked one box in the survey means it is unlikely that they responded with every community that they are part of, just the identity they feel is most important. This impact of subjects only selecting a single response in these types of questions and the impact it has is discussed further in the discussion of framework. 


\subsection{Access to Survey. }
While access to survey does not appear to have influence on awareness of local knowledge, the results are important for the discussion on how to create a framework for determining resilience of a place.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/access_survey.png}
    \caption{Access to Survey - The most common access method of the survey was poster, with 70 subjects selecting this choice. This is followed by social media which has 47 subjects choosing this. Only 25 subjects accessed the survey due to personal connection to researcher. Access via email, place of employment and organisation membership are all under 10. Subjects could chose more than one access type. For example a subject could have accessed via personal connection to researcher and social media, due to the researcher sharing this survey on her personal page. }
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}

The key result for future research is that data collection using posters was a popular access method. 50 posters were printed. To see the communication design principles influence on the poster design, you can find it attached in the appendix. These posters were split evenly between the research sites and half were placed at the start of data collection and the other half after the first month. The results shown in figure 5.16 are again influenced by the subjects tendency to tick only one box, when there was the option to tick several. For example, it is known that many of the subjects who have personal connections to the researcher actually accessed the survey via social media or organisational membership. This tendency and its influence on the results is expanded upon in the discussion of results and the discussion of framework. 
\paragraph{}

25 subjects responded that they accessed the survey via personal connection to the researcher. The effect of the researchers pre-existing local knowledge and pre-existing network on this research is not expanded upon here. Though there may have been some impact, this result indicates that if this project was done in a location where the researcher does not have a connection would not have had a significant impact. 

\subsection{Perceived Risks}
As can be seen in the appendix survey questions about the perceiving of risks were only asked about towards the end. The information received and subjects mentioned earlier likely influenced the results of these questions as can be seen in figure 5.17 and 5.18 below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/infrastructure-risks.png}
    \caption{Perceived risks to Infrastructure Risks - 97 subjects selected storm surges as a risk to infrastructure. Only 4 subjects responded that they perceived no major risks to infrastructure and 11 subjects responded that they don't know. Human error was only selected by 27 subjects making it the risk the least number of subjects were concerned about. There is greater perception of weather impacts on infrastructure with 47 subjects highlighting strong winds, 51 subjects selecting waves, 56 subjects selecting strong tides and 38 selecting precipitation. After storm surges which were mentioned multiple times in the survey there is a perception of shoreline instability with 77 subjects selecting it as a risk to infrastructures.   }
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}
This survey will have influenced the subjects perception of risk, it is unlikely that 97 subjects would have selected storm surges as a risk to infrastructure before carrying out this survey. The impacts of citizen science and perception of risk is expanded upon in the discussion of framework, including the high levels of perception that shoreline instability is a risk to infrastructure in the research sites.

As with the results in figure 5.17, the results shown in figure 5.18 will have been influenced by the survey. How this type of research impacts awareness and in turn resilience is further discussed in the discussion of framework. 


\section{Awareness}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/2022-hightide-answers.png}
    \caption{Subjects Predicted Height of Current High Tide. Height 0.5m is the neap high tide, Height 1.2m is the Spring High Tide. The vast majority of subjects selected an answer which corresponds with models of tides in Trondheim. Under 20 subjects responded with an answer which does not correspond with models of tides. 58 subjects chose 0.5m, 77 subjects chose 1.2m meaning that 135 out of 153 subjects, 88 percent chose what could be considered the correct answer for high tide. Only 13 subjects chose 2.2m and 3 subjects chose 2.7m}
    \label{fig:high-tide-answer}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}
 Figure 5.19 shows that the subjects displayed a high awareness of the tides in Trondheim. Under 20 subjects responded with an answer which does not reflect the models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. Over 88 percent of subjects chose a value which matches with models by \cite{kartverket_se_2021} The majority of respondents chose the answer of 1.2m which corresponds with the spring tide. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/2022-20yrss-answer.png}
    \caption{Subjects Predicted Height of Current 20 Year Storm Surge. 61 subjects chose 1.2m this is very comparable to the 60 which chose 2.2m which is the answer which corresponds with \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. 24 subjects chose 2.7m and only 6 subjects chose 3.0m}
    \label{fig:2022-stormsurge-answers}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}
The majority of subjects chose 1.2m as the predicted height of the 20 year storm surge, this does not correspond with models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. In fact 1.2m is equal to the current high tide. Almost equally well chosen was the answer which does correspond with models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}, 2.2m, with 60 subjects choosing this answer. This means that 43 percent of subjects chose the answer which corresponds with \cite{kartverket_se_2021}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/2090s 20yr ss answers.png}
    \caption{Subjects Predicted Height of 2090's, 20 year storm surge. The majority of subjects chose the highest value with 70 subjects choosing 3.0m as the predicted height of the storm surge. 47 subjects chose 2.7m which is the value which corresponds with models by \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. 27 subjects chose 2.2m and only 5 subjects chose 1.2m}
    \label{fig:2090-stormsurge-answers}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}
The majority of subjects predicted the storm surge in 2090 to be 3.0m. Just over 30 percent chose 2.7m which is the value which corresponds with models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. This means that most people thought the sea level extreme associated with the 20 year storm surge in 2090 is higher than it is currently predicted to be. The change of height for the 20 year storm surge predicted for 2090 is only 50cm higher than the current 20 year storm surge \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. 
\paragraph{}

    \caption{Subjects Predictions for how Sea Level will change in Trondheim in Next 30 years. Only 147 subjects answered for this question, unlike every other one which all subjects, 153, answered. No subjects believed the sea level will decrease over the next 30 years. One subject answered that it will stay the same, with every other subject choosing that it will rise by some level }
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

There is strong uncertainty with this measurement in models, due to the unknown of emission patterns over the next 30 years and isostatic uplift. Nevertheless an estimation of 20cm or 10cm is in line with \cite{kartverket_se_2021} which uses the upper emissions pathways from the IPCC. Over half of the subjects chose an answer which is in line with models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. However equal numbers of subjects, 26 , chose 50cm as chosen 20cm,  which is not in line with these models. Almost all subjects answered that sea level will rise in the next 30 years, though six subjects chose not to answer this question.  

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Subjects Predictions for how Sea Level has Changed in Trondheim over last 30 years. Only 3 subjects chose that sea level has decreased in the last 30 years, this answer is inline with \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. 20 subjects answered that sea level had not changed over this time. While 31 subjects answered that it had risen by 10 cm. 18 subjects answered that it had risen by 20 cm and 3 answered that it had risen by 50 cm. 52 subjects answered that sea level had risen over the last 30 years. }

Figure 5.25 is the sum of all results pictured above in this section on awareness. This was the first attempt to determine awareness of subjects from the results of this survey

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/aware_all.png}
    \caption{Awareness Considering all Questions which were designed to determine awareness. Only 2 subjects had all answers corresponding with the models from \cite{kartverket_se_2020}. 9 subjects had 4 answers corresponding, 40 subjects had 3 answers corresponding, 65 subjects had 2 answers corresponding, 31 subjects had 1 answer corresponding and 6 subjects had no answers corresponding. }
    \label{fig:aware-all}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}

 Awareness determination considering all answers related to questions was not the most suitable for analysing factors related to awareness. For this reason another determination of awareness was created utilising only the questions which had pictures of the simulated water levels. This is discussed further in chapter 6. 
\paragraph{}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/Awareness_ all_simulation_pictures_qs.png}
    \caption{Awareness considering all Simulated Water Level Questions. The results here are more evenly spread than in figure 5.25, with the majority of subjects classing as somewhat aware. Only 10 subjects had no answers corresponding with the models from \cite{kartverket_se_2020}, when only considering the questions which use a visual simulation of the water levels associated with sea level extremes. While 20 subjects responded with every answer corresponding with the model for these questions. 64 subjects responded to one of the four questions with answers which corresponded with the models. 59 subjects responded with 2 answers which corresponded with the models. }
    \label{fig:aware_all}
\end{figure}

The determination of awareness displayed in the figure above was chosen as the most appropriate variable due to the fact that only awareness questions with a simulated water level picture were included, as can be seen in the appendix. The other determination of awareness included the results from two questions which were based purely off numeric answers which gave very skewed results. When given just numeric responses, the accurate rate was non significant. For example, only 3 subjects out of 153 gave the correct answer for projections of sea level change in the last 30 years as shown in Figure 5.23.  This is unlikely given that it was multiple choice with only 7 potential answers (if split evenly then would have 21 subjects choosing this response. Figure 5.22 subjects predictions for how sea level will change in the next 30 years has more correct responses. This was only mildly significant, which combined with the lack of correct answers as shown in figure 5.23 was considered a valid reason to exclude the answers to both of these questions for creating the variable of awareness. 
\paragraph{}
Another determination of awareness was considered which only includes results from questions on current storm surge and current high tide, excluding results of the question of the 20 year storm surge in 2090. This was considered as a potential baseline variable for current awareness to sea level extremes as different from awareness to future sea level extremes. However, the variable summary statistics are similar. 


\paragraph{}
As shown by the focus group there is issues with just requesting a numeric value from subjects. There is a higher potential connection for many individuals including another emotional layer when using pictures rather than numbers. 

\section{Factors Affecting Awareness}
The results from the survey for both the variables and factors were skewed as can be seen from the figures in the section above. The analysis was carried out using RStudio and then exported to Microsoft Excel to utilise their templates for graphs. The results from the histogram analysis is that no variable of awareness appeared normally distributed. Upon basic transformation, including logarithmic and cubing, it was highly skewed. Furthermore, almost all factors from the results were skewed as can be seen in the section above.   

\subsection{Shapiro Test Results}

During histogram analysis, only the factors of "interest-level" and "info-climate-sum" appeared normally distributed. To investigate whether these variables were truly normally distributed a Shapiro test was carried out using \cite{royston_extension_1982} . Due to inexperience with this method it was first checked on variables which from the histograms were clearly skewed. From these tests and \cite{royston_extension_1982} an assumption of alpha value of 0.05 was determined meaningful. This means if the p-value created during this test is below 0.05 then the null hypothesis is rejected. This does leave a 5 percent chance of error. The results from the Shapiro test can be seen in table 5.5 and this determines that none of the variables were normally distributed. 

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
         \textbf{ Variable } &  \textbf{W-value}& \textbf{ P-Value}& \textbf{Distribution}\\ \hline
       Interest Level & 0.89332 & 4.343e-09 & Skewed \\ \hline
         Info Climate Sum  & 0.95721 & 0.0001159 & Skewed \\ \hline
        Flood Impact & 0.87779 & 6.681e-10 & Skewed \\ \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \caption{Shapiro Test Results. The alpha value was assigned 0.05, meaning that if the p-value is below 0.05 then the null hypothesis that this factor is not normally distributed was rejected. This leaves a 5 percent chance of error. Each of these factors p-value is below 0.05 meaning that their distribution was deemed skewed.Interest Level is when subjects self-identified their interest level in sea level extremes, ranging from professional interest to no interest. Info Climate Sum is the total of how many different sources subjects used to gather information about the climate. Flood impact is what the subjects predicted a flood in the place would impact them ranging from no impact to significant impact. }
    \label{table:shapiro_test_results}
\end{table}
\paragraph{}

This result that all variables and factors were skewed, including the important variable of awareness and interest level, influenced the choice of how to analyse dependency. Mixed effect linear models were considered, but the purpose of this project was to find fast ways of analysing resilience and what social factors could be worked on to improve resilience. For this reason, non-parametric tests were selected. As outlined in the method (chapter 3) Kruskal Wallis Rank Sum Tests were chosen due to the need to investigate multiple groups, upon one factor -awareness- and having only measured each subject once. Both \cite{tasman_how_2014} and \cite{hollander_nonparametric_2014} were consulted to make this decision. 

\subsection{Kruskal Wallis Rank Sum Test}
Kruskal Wallis Rank Sum Test was conducted using RStudio, specifically the package based off \cite{hollander_nonparametric_2014}. Kruskal Wallis Rank Sum Test was chosen due to the the distribution of the results and the potential inter-dependency of the data. Linear modelling was also considered and trialled, but this technique includes the skewed aspect of the data better, when looking for dependents. An alpha value of 0.05 was chosen before these test were carried out. This means there is a 5 percent chance of inaccuracy when determining dependency of factors against the variable of awareness.

Table 5.6 shows that, for this determination of awareness, none of the factors were classed as dependent, when using the Kruskal Wallis rank sum test with an alpha value of 0.05.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
         ~ &Awareness as predictor & ~ & ~ \\ \hline

    \caption{Kruskal Wallis Test Results General Variables}
    \label{Kruskal_wallis_test_general}
\end{table}

All the p-values were larger than the alpha value of 0.05. However, the factor of Concern about Climate  is 0.05630 as highlighted in blue is only just over.  If the alpha value was chosen to be 0.1, as is used in some studies (\cite{hollander_nonparametric_2014}) then this would be enough to reject the null hypothesis that concern about awareness is not dependent upon concern about climate. Another way the hypothesis could have been accepted is due to the high h-value, however as df was under 5 this did not give enough confidence to accept the hypothesis (\cite{minitab_interpret_2022}). The conclusion here is that there is not strong enough evidence that this determination of awareness is dependent upon Concern about Climate.

    \caption{Kruskal Wallis Test Results Community Membership. Other community membership was self reporting: the most common response was tourist, with sailor coming next.

    \label{Kruskal_wallis_test_general}
\end{table}

An alpha value of 0.05 was chosen and the factor of community membership - resident has a P-value of 0.01524, hence is significant. Meaning the null hypothesis of no relationship was rejected and the positive hypothesis that residency is dependent on awareness was accepted. 




As the P-value for the variable community membership -residence is greater than the alpha (could assign 0.05 as is common or assign 0.1 which would make it easier to include a few more variables for discussion) The differences between some of the medians are statistically significant.

    \label{Kruskal_wallis_test_information}
\end{table}

Kruskal wallis test indicate that Resident is a factor for awareness, it could be a random factor, which would mean a more appropriate method than basic linear modelling is linear mixed effect modelling. Linear mixed effect modelling should consider Resident as a random factor for the determiation of awarenes utilisng all 5 questions and for the determination of awareness only using questions with a visual simulated sea level, then infor-climate-edu and info-climate-newspaper may be random factors.

Info-climate-sum and com-mem included factors which influence the chosen baseline variable, but do not in and of themselves appear dependent from the kruskal wallis test. However it does highlight that these factors may be important considerations and are worth trialling with linear mixed effect modeling.



\section{Hypothesis Testing Summary}
To summarise the results from the hypothesis testing it is put in the format of the original hypothesises shown in the introduction. 
%could break it down into section is 
%\subsection{ Awareness and Place}
%\subsection{Awareness and Language}
%\subsection{Awareness and Community Membership}
%\subsection{Awareness and Level of Interest}
%\subsection{Awareness and Information Access}

\subsection{Hypothesis dependent on community membership}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We expect residents to be aware - accepted
    \item We expect commuters to be aware - rejected
    \item We expect marine workers to be aware - no result
    \item We expect non-marine workers to be unaware - no result
    \item We expect water leisure users to be aware - rejected
    \item We expect land leisure users to be unaware - rejected
    \end{enumerate}
\paragraph{}

\subsection{Hypothesis dependent on local knowledge}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We expect subjects with professional interest in SLE's to be aware - not accepted
    \item We expect subjects with primary knowledge about places which are on reclaimed land to be aware - awareness does not appear to be dependant on place
    \item We expect subjects with a length of knowledge greater than 20 years of the area to be aware -  awareness does not appear to be dependent on length of knowledge
    \item We expect subjects with a length of knowledge less than 1 year of the area to be unaware -   awareness does not appear to be dependent on length of knowledge
    \item We expect subjects with many information sources about the place to be aware - awareness does not appear to be dependent on information sources about place
    \item We expect subjects who chose to respond in Norwegian to be aware - no observation of awareness being dependent on whether the subjects responded in Norwegian or English
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{}

\subsection{Hypothesis dependent on awareness of changing climate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We expect subjects with many information sources about climate change to be more aware - awareness does appear to have a dependency on where the subject got information about the climate from, however there is no observed link between more sources having a greater impact on awareness
    \item We expect subjects with the information source of formal education to be aware - Awareness of the current sea level extremes, but not the future ones, does appear to be dependent upon getting information about the climate from formal education. 
    \item We expect subjects with the information source of peer reviewed publications to be aware - awareness does not have an observed dependency on subjects getting information from peer review publications
    \item We expect subjects who are more concerned about climate change to be aware - it is not particularly significant, but we have found that awareness is not dependent upon climate change, but further research is needed on this result as it was borderline and could have been shifted if a slightly larger alpha value was chosen.
    \item We expect subjects who predict they will be impacted by flooding from SLE's to be more aware -  rejected
\end{enumerate}

Very few of the hypotheses were accepted. The reasons for this are expanded upon in the next section Discussion of Results

\section{Summary of Results}
The key result from the pilot survey and focus group is that determining awareness from surveys was an appropriate method for use in determination of social resilience to sea level extremes in a place. Also, that utilisation of maps was not appropriate for the research sites chosen due to the low level of projected changes and that simulated images of visual extremes were a better choice. From the data-sets used and literature review, technological and natural systems projected changes in vulnerability and how they impact resilience were outlined. With current city organisation, only once sea level extremes reach the height of 269cm, which is the projection for the 20 year return height in 2090, is a critical building due to be impacted. Information access and community membership appear to be factors in the determined awareness of subjects. Over half of subjects select storm surges as a perceived risk to people and infrastructure. Subjects appear to be somewhat aware of the changing sea level extremes. The format in which questions of sea level extremes are asked appears to have an impact.
