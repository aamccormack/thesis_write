\subsection{Awareness}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/2022-hightide-answers.png}
    \caption{Subjects Predicted Height of Current High Tide. Height 0.5m is the neep high tide, Height 1.2m is the Spring High Tide. Th vast majority of subjects got an answer which corresponds with models of tides in Trondheim. Under 20 subjects responded with an answer which does not correspond with models of tides. 58 subjects chose 0.5m, 77 subjects chose 1.2m meaning that 135 out of 153 subjects, 88 percent chose what could be considered the correct answer for high tide. While only 13 subjects chose 2.2m and 3 subjects chose 2.7m}
    \label{fig:high-tide-answer}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in figure ** above the subjects displayed a high awareness of the tides in Trondheim. Under 20 subjects responded with an answer which does not reflect the models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. Over 88 percent of subjects chose a value which matches with models by \cite{kartverket_se_2021} The majority of respondents chose the answer of 1.2m which corresponds with the Spring tide. 

\begin{figure} [h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/2022-20yrss-answer.png}
    \caption{Subjects Predicted Height of Current 20 Year Storm Surge. 61 subjects chose 1.2m this is very comparable to the 60 which chose 2.2m which is the answer which corresponds with \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. 24 subjects chose 2.7m and only 6 subjectts chose 3.0m}
    \label{fig:2022-stormsurge-answers}
\end{figure}

The majority of subjects chose 1.2m as the predicted height of the 20 year storm surge, this does not correspond with models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. In fact 1.2m is equal to the current high tide. Almost equally well chosen was the answer which does correspond with models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}, 2.2m, with 60 subjects choosing this answer. This means that 43 percent of subjects chose the answer which corresponds with \cite{kartverket_se_2021}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig_results/2090s 20yr ss answers.png}
    \caption{Subjects Predicted Height of 2090's, 20 year storm surge. The majority of subjects chose the highest value with 70 subjects choosing 3.0m as the predicted height of the storm surge. 47 subjects chose 2.7m which is the value which corresponds with models by \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. 27 subjects chose 2.2m and only 5 subjects chose 1.2m}
    \label{fig:2090-stormsurge-answers}
\end{figure}

The majority of subjects predicted the storm surge in 2090 to be 3.0m. Just over 30 percent chose 2.7m which is the value which corresponds with models from \cite{kartverket_se_2021}. This means that most people thought the sea level extreme associated with the 20 year storm surge in 2090 is higher than it is currently predicted to be. The change of height for the 20 year storm surge predicted for 2090 is only 50cm higher than the current 20 year storm surge \cite{kartverket_se_2021}.
