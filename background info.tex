\section{Communication Design}
guidelines used for survey design

guidelines used for advertising

guidelines used for visual communication

guidelines used for communication about climate change

To maximise use of citizen science communication styles is very important including accessibility. In this section I will got into detail about the various methods I used to reach participants and encourage them to fill in my survey. Accessibility, trust and legitimacy are important attributes with all citizen science, but even more so in subjects with a potential emotional impact. A simulated image which shows a place a participant cares about as being impacted by a sea level extreme could result in a strong emotional impact which if not handled carefully could turn the participant away from the survey and research on this in general.


•	General design principles
o	 I used 2 sites 
%https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/d34681ac0d1a417894a3a3d955c6913f?item=15 story map accessible design principles 
%https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
Plus experience in coms and map design
Which highlights succinct is king
•	Communication style guideline used

o	climate change: A Handbook for IPCC authors. Oxford: Climate Outreach 
•	Website 
o	url shortener
o	accessibility
o	design for smartphones and laptop/desktops
o	easy to use
o	ux / ui design funnels you to the survey
o	professional 
o	personal brand utilisation to confer trust and legitimacy
•	Email
o	 Succinct is key
o	When appropriate utilisation of university email
	To provide legitimacy
	To avoid spam filters
o	Not used when I already had personal connection with targeted company
o	Who did I email 
•	Poster
o	Qr code
o	Nice pic which targets water users
•	Social media
o	Timing!
o	Videos on fb are prioritised by algorithm
o	So made loop of changing SLEs as gif and as video
o	Engagement rate
•	Utilisation of researcher contacts
•	Results from survey how did you access survey
o	Especially how many had personal connection to researcher
•	To maintain legitimacy will need to communicate the results of my research to participants after I am finished – will send an email to participants who requested more info and will post to website
