\chapter{Discussion of Framework for Determining Resilience}
The overall objective of this project was to assist the creation of a framework for cheaply and quickly determining the resilience of place. This chapter discusses the lessons learnt from this project with a view to repetition of this type of research.

\section{Software Consideration}
The ease of providing data was a key design factor considered when designing the data collection method for this project. The goal was to create an online survey which could be completed by most participants in under 5 minutes, without missing out on potentially valuable data. This required a balancing act between maximising potential data gathered from a single participant and maximising the number of participants. To do this, several iterations were created and trialled as outlined earlier.
\paragraph{}
An online survey method was chosen due to the method's ease of data codification, repeatability and accessibility. Avoidance of disease spread was also a consideration. The major downside of this technique is that it could exclude certain sectors of society due to lack of access to the internet. However, in Norway over 99 percent of the population have access to the internet (ssb https://www.ssb.no/en/statbank/table/11000/tableViewLayout1/ ) 
\paragraph{}
The most appropriate software was then considered.  Various software packages were explored and then short surveys were created and  tested on desktops, laptops, tablets, IOS smartphones and Android Smartphones, to determine the best option. The results of this exploration are outlined on table 7.1.

\end{table}

Due to its ability to gather GIS data, the ArcGIS Survey123 was the original software choice. The plan was that participants could draw upon an uploaded map where they believed the SLEs to be. This was thought to be the best technique as it would have a lesser influence on answers and would allow for interesting GIS analysis. 
\paragraph{}

However, difficulties arose as this software struggled with more than one map being used in a single survey. There were also difficulties of inputting this information on a smartphone. For this reason, a comparative pilot survey was created to compare the usability of ArcGIS Survey123 with Nettskjema. While ArcGIS Survey123 allowed for input of GIS data, Nettskjema does not.

\section{Pilot Survey and Focus Group Impacts to Project}
Nettskjema was ultimately chosen due to its reliability, security, link strength and range of question formats.  This decision did minimise the spatial aspect of communication and decreased the variety in possible responses. 
\paragraph{}
The pilot survey and focus group were used to decide how information on SLEs would best be communicated - maps, edited photographs or numerical values. Maps show the spatial aspect of flood impacts more clearly than the edited photographs. However, using simulated images allows for the interpretation to be easier and to potentially have more emotional impact: for many people it is easier to place themselves within the context of a photograph of an known location. Greater psychological distancing can occur with the use of maps. The caveat is that the photographs have to have a semblance of reality. Image editing is a slow process, particularly when aiming for realism.  A fuller explanation of how the simulated images were created is given in the methodology chapter. 
\paragraph{}

When redesigning the survey after the Pilot Survey and Focus Group, a greater focus was on accessibility. The new survey was tested on several participants with mild visual and language difficulties (dyslexia, less familiarity with the language, astigmatism).  Each of these participants took under six minutes to complete the survey, with an average of five minutes hence fulfilling the design choice that the majority should be able to complete the survey in under five minutes. 
\paragraph{}



\section{Demographics}
Resilience and vulnerability are impacted by demographic variables (\cite{rod_integrated_2012}), but there are ethical implications to improving resilience by changing population demographics. Arguing a place is not resilient simply due to there being a high percentage of women, or immigrants, or the age of the population is not a useful nor moral lens in which to discuss improvements to resilience. It can be worthwhile to highlight areas or groups who are particularly vulnerable in order to provide them with extra support. Forcing groups to disperse against their will is not the purpose of the majority of vulnerability indices. For this reason, standard demographic questions were not part of this survey. 


\paragraph{}
Whether the subjects reached truly represent Trondheim's stakeholders for SLEs can be debated. For example, survey participants were self selecting so those with higher interest levels in SLEs were more likely to participate. There is also a strong skew towards subjects who are concerned about climate change. Attempts to reach as wide a pool of stakeholders were made. Encouraging them to participate was done by utilising the communication guidelines, making the survey as short and as easy to do as possible and by utilizing the researcher's network. 



\section{Limitations of single-risk, single-scale risk analysis}
There is an increasing demand for multi-risk, multi-scale, multi-stakeholder determination of risk and resilience (\cite{gerkensmeier_governing_2018} and \cite{cutter_community_2020}). An attempt has been made to display a method for quickly and cheaply determining social resilience utilising the views of many stakeholders. There is limitations to this results of Trondheim being considered resilient as it is dependent only on the risk from SLEs. As highlighted by the subjects, there are other risks including risk of landslides. Landslide due to quick clay are also impacted by weather conditions, much like SLEs. 
\paragraph{}
While Trondheim is considered to currently have projected resilience for SLEs for the period of 2022 to 2050 and 2050 to 2100, this does not mean that normality will quickly be returned to if multiple other incidents occurred at the same time. These other risks could be natural hazards or caused by human choice. How best to include all hazards in a determination of resilience should be looked at in further research. The balance between the need to have a quick and cheap determination of resilience to allow for repeated measurement to search for trends against the need to consider all forms of hazard is a difficult balance.
\paragraph{}


\section{Summary of Limitations of Technique}
The COVID-19 pandemic provided significant limitations to this research. This was the main factor in the decision to only use surveys and not complement with interviews. Furthermore, resilience is dynamic and will have been affected by the pandemic. 
\paragraph{}
The data collection limitations include the number of subjects and the impact of only surveying during the summer. The lack of marine workers within the subjects is a major limitation of this study, but does not prevent an overview of local knowledge of SLEs. Particularly important is the limitation of only having the results for one year, which creates a snapshot of resilience rather than considering how it is changing overtime.  The exclusion of Nyhavvna as a research site is a limitation, which could be corrected in a repetition of this research.  The final limitation is the analysis technique which was limited due to the skewed distribution of the survey results.


\section{Future Research}
If repeating this project the researcher would change several aspects. The first aspect is making sure that for questions where subjects could select several answers they were made clear that it was requested that they select all the apply to them. The research would also either chose a different term than resident, or make it clearer what was meant by this term when collecting the data. 
\paragraph{}
In terms of reaching stakeholders this could have been improved by sending emails earlier. The results of survey access are likely impacted by this projects data collection having been conducted in the summer. An example email is included in the appendix and it is recognised that perhaps this could have been designed better. On the subject of survey access, it would be interesting to repeat the posters, but set it up so that it is clear which poster location subjects accessed the surveys via. The link between the subjects location and their response could be interesting; to do this the privacy of the subjects would need to be considered. The understanding of how subjects viewed place could be expanded upon. Perhaps another focus group on this subject could be conducted, or a stakeholder workshop. 
\paragraph{}
It is predicted that future researchers may try to utilise AI in a determination of a places resilience. Currently AI is not good at working with multiple data-sets or prioritising which data is most important. AI is costly and still has a long way to go before it should be trusted with determinations which can impact this many peoples lives. Currently the use of other technology to decrease cost and improve speed of determination of resilience is suggested as a better focus. Technology such as GIS, online surveys and utilising dynamic documents. That all of the subjects responses could be utilised with minimal re-coding was due to the design of the data collection. This is much quicker than taking paper surveys and then inputting them into machines for data analysis.
\paragraph{}
Finally the likelihood of there being another SLE in Trondheim before anyone gets the chance to repeat this research is significant. If this research was to be repeated it would be important to add any new sea level extreme events to the question on do you remember these events.
