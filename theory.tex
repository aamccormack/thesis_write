\subsection{Citizen Science}
Words to define: 
•	Citizen Science \cite{tweddle_guide_2012}
Why citizen science for this project 

\subsection{Stakeholders}

The stakeholders primarily considered during this project are the people who live commute or work in coastal Trondheim. This was decided using \cite{reed_stakeholder_nodate} as a back up for a very basic stakeholder analysis. Other stakeholders consdiered are people with attachment to the research sites as well as well as planners and policy makers. Creating a full understanding prior to research of who was a stakeholder was not a priority as the primary research method relies upon stakeholders to self identify as those who decided to take part in this research. However targeting of subjects utilising the decided upon stakeholders was done. 

The stakeholders identity is a key part of the research. The nature of stakeholder participation during this project was limited to communication and consultation according to Rowe and Frower 2000 in \cite{reed_stakeholder_nodate}. How these stakeholders are categorised is top down as community membership of certain groups were targeted with the ability to identify as these groups during the survey. However there was also bottom up stakeholder identification as subjects could write in which groups they felt part of, beyond those decided on during the project design. Stakeholder theory is not one of the lenses in which these results are analysed, however an understanding of what and who the stakeholders are in the changing impacts of sea level extremes in Trondheim was essential to allow the assessment of local knowledge and awareness.

\subsection{Vulnerability}

\subsection{Space,Time, Place} 
To understand resilience we must ask resilience: for whom; of what; to what; of where; how and when \cite{cutter_community_2020}, \cite{moser_turbulent_2019}. Resilience is temporally and spatially dynamic \cite{cutter_community_2020}. Hence a basic description of what is meant here by space, time and place is necessary. The conceptualisation used here is inline with \cite{massey_for_2005}, where space is the dimension of simultaneity and is part of space-time. In this view space is considered as the dimension of things being and importantly occurring at the same time. In contrast time is considered as things occurring one after the other. This conceptualisation of space-time is relevant for private, public and even virtual spaces and gives room for the social networks that operate within these spaces \cite{massey_for_2005} \cite{allen_rethinking_1998}.

The four chosen research places are created upon a combination of public and private space. The edge of the water itself is usually considered public space *REF* but there is also space allocated to specific groups which can create feelings of in-place vs out-of-place. Place is considered as an assemblage of traces. These traces range from the historical and global to the local and present and it is these combinations of traces which combine to make these places \cite{anderson_understanding_2015} \cite{massey_for_2005}. As well as explicit group membership the traces of place influence who can feel in-place and what is culturally and legally allowable uses of the places \cite{anderson_understanding_2015}. The four research sites include a wide demographic users of who can be considered in-place, but the power relationships and the in-place members affect the resilience of the location. 

\subsection{Awareness}
To understand the current resilience of a place requires an understanding of the awareness of the people who interact with and define the place. An individual’s ability to rank their level of awareness about a subject is a long investigated and debated topic *ref*. It is generally preferable to allow them to display their level of awareness rather than ask them on a sliding scale how aware they are. This is especially important when trying to explore knowledge which may have previously been seen as lesser.

To determine awareness level three questions were set in the survey used. These questions were designed to be simple and quick to answer in a format which would allow the author to analyse awareness about sea level extremes in the present and future along with general knowledge of the sea. Awareness about tide level, current risk of storm surges, past resilience to storm surges and future resilience to storm surges was investigated. Further information of how different question techniques and formats were trialled, and the influence of the decided questions format can be found in the Discussion section.

The choice which format method to use while asking about sea level changes is likely to have an influence on how participants perceive this change. For example considering change as metres in height vs area of land influenced may results in different perceptions of the changing risks and potential impacts.  By sticking firmly in the realm of historical fact and scientific models with these questions there has been an attempt to investigate awareness of SLEs rather than perception.

Resilience is impacted by the behaviour of those who are potentiall impacted by the potential hazard. Awareness is influenced by many factors. Fig ** above is based on \cite{whitmarsh_are_2008} and \cite{lujala_climate_2015} . Where the green box labelled "Natural Hazard Risk" is the awareness of the individual. The three triangles are the prsims of "percieved distance", "personal experience" and "values" which have a signigicant impact on how this awareness is manifested as attitude to the natural hazard risk. This "attitude" is then put through the lens of "resources" before influencing the behaviour of the individual. 

Of course people's information in, to thought, to behaviour process are much more complicated than the visualisation above, but it is helpful to considered these prisms and lens when attempting to understand why individuals behave as they do. There is assumptions that those with higher levels of awareness about risks are more likely to have certain attitudes and in turn certain behaviours, but this is not always the case. 
*MORE ABOUT*\cite{lujala_climate_2015}  Awareness of the changing tides and risk of storm surges is considered here as an aspect of local knowledge and is one of the key factors investigated to determine the resilience of Trondheim to sea level extremes. 






\section{Resilience}
Resilience - cutter

\section{Projecting Resilience of Place}
Key theories:
•	DROP cutter
•	Social systems as what defines resilience
•	Projected resilience as dynamic process which influences outcomes (i.e. resilience as measured post disaster). 
•	Cutter et al 2008
•	Cutter 2020 
•	Moser et al 2019 

\section{Defining Resilience} 
Resilience is here considered as the ability to return to normality as quickly as possible after disaster this is in line with (Cutter, 2019:Löw, 2019).

"present does not define future resilience, but it does influence it. Resilience as dynamic and dependent on 3 changing systems -natural, social and technological
" \cite{cutter_community_2020} views of resilience.

Sea Level Extremes can cause disaster, but this is not necessarily the case. A sea level extreme thus can be viewed as a possible disaster which is referred to here as an event. 

""Resilience is the ability of a social system to respond and recover from disasters and includes those inherent conditions that allow the system to absorb impacts and cope with an event, as well as post-event, adaptive processes that facilitate the ability of the social system to re-organize, change, and learn in response to a threat" "Vulnerability is the pre-event, inherent characteristics or qualities of social systems that create the potential for harm. Vulnerability is a function of the exposure (who or what is at risk) and sensitivity of system (the degree to which people and places can beharmed" " \cite{cutter_place-based_2008}

Resilience is an ongoing dynamic process. When discussing resilience in this thesis we are discussing projected resilience. Hence what is the projected ability to return to normality as quickly as possible after an sea level extreme event. 
 
Focusing on place based resilience and including community and institutions under the social system aspect
Rather than using community resilience in its place-based approach as commonly conceptualised in Norway both in National and local policy documents and by “layperson” (Räsänen et al 2020). Especially as highlighted by (Räsänen et al 2020) that how useful current place -based metirics are for measuring community resilience and that there is need for other techniques. Hence don’t ignore community but place it under social systems.

SLE = WAVE + SEA LEVEL + TIDE + STORM SURGES + land movement

Storm Surge
“Storm surges are high water levels in the sea that occur during spring tides in combination with special weather conditions such as low air pressure and strong onshore winds.” According to the kommune (Einar Aassved Hanssen, Marianne Langedal, 2013) – stormflo = storm surge
“Safety against floods and storm surges is regulated by safety classes based on the
largest nominal annual probability. Flood sizes are usually stated with a number of
years of repetition intervals. The recurrence interval indicates how often a flood or
storm surge of the same magnitude occurs on average over many long years. A flood
with a recurrence interval of 200 years, also called a 200-year flood, occurs on average
every 200 years. Each year, the probability of a 200-year flood is equal to 1/200, ie 0.5 percent.
This does not exclude that one can get two 200-year floods at short intervals.
Calculation of recurrence intervals for floods and storm surges is based on historical
observations, and measurement of water flow or water level.”
