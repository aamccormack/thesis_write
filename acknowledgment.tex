\section{Preface}
This is a Master's thesis completed as part of the study program Natural Resources Management MSc at NTNU in the department of Geography. Data collection occurred during the summer of 2022. The idea for the thesis occurred to the researcher during a kayaking expedition in Lofoten where they came across many individuals with direct memory and experience of sea level change and extreme sea levels. \\[2cm]
