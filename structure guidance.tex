Intro / foreword

Norway’s resilience to sea level extremes is and has been a dynamic process. To better protect coastal infrastructure and populations an understanding of how this resilience is changing is required. Resilience is impacted by many factors which can be considered as falling within three key systems. The natural, technological and social systems. These interplay to alter the level of resilience and risk within places. Sea level extremes are and extremely localised hazard in Norway and the understanding of this risk needs to be at a regional rather than national or global level. 
Changes to Norways Reslience to SLEs
•	Climate
•	Social 
•	Geographic/ geological
•	Link to examples of change of risk
•	Link to global changes in Sles
Project purpose
•	Determine resilience to sea level extremes in 4 key places in Trondheim
•	Assist creation of framework for quickly and cheaply determining a places resilience to changing sea level extremes
•	Connect local knowledge to academic knowledge
Link to un sdgs – 9, 11, 13
UN SDGS that are relevant 
9 - Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
11 - Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
13 - Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts


Theory
What is a SLE?
What is Resilience?
•	What is resilience
•	Projecting resilience
•	Natural + social + technical systems which impact resilience
Why Resilience of Place (rather than community)
•	DROP model Cutter
Make sure key terms are defined and explained
•	Resilience
•	Storm surge
•	Uplift
•	High water
•	Tide
•	Place
•	Disaster / event
•	20-year storm surge
•	Risk
•	vulnerability

Locations of Project Background

Trondheim and SlEs
•	2.06 m high water (NN2000)
•	Maximum observed in Trondheim is 2.60m in 1971
•	City plans for 4.87m by 2100
•	More details on chosen research areas
•	Include maps here 
•	Social demographic stats
•	Risk level stats

Citizen Science
•	Pros and cons
•	Why important for this project
•	How I did it with respect to communities
Method Considerations
•	Pilot survey
•	Focus group
•	Results
Methodology
Method of gathering data
o	Website details
o	Poster details
o	Email details
o	Social media details
o	Importance of doing these to a high standard to maximise subject numbers and wide range of subject
o	And to inspire trust especially when this is a emotionally tricky subject
•	Method of analysing data
o	Excel
o	R
o	Maps?
Results
Discussion of results
Results related to research qs
•	Descriptive statistics
•	Results R1, R2, R3 
•	Method consideration
o	Survey limitations
•
