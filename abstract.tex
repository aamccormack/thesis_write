\section{Abstract}

Norway’s resilience to sea level extremes is a dynamic process. To better protect coastal populations and infrastructure an understanding of how this resilience is changing is required. Improving the resilience of human settlements is required by UN SDG's 11 and 13. Resilience is impacted by many factors which can be considered as falling within three key systems:  natural, technological and social. These systems interplay to alter the level of resilience within places. Sea level extremes are extremely localised hazard in Norway and the understanding of this risk needs to be at a regional rather than national or global level. As climate, population distribution and geological setting change the resilience to sea level extremes of places in Norway change. The purpose of this project is to determine resilience to sea level extremes in 4 key sites in Trondheim and assist the creation of a framework for quickly and cheaply determining a places resilience to changing sea level extremes. Investigating the link between local knowledge and academic models of sea level change in Trondheim is part of this process, including investigating which factors make individuals more aware of the risks of sea level extremes. 

This was done using a survey. *add sentence summarising results*
The subjects representing all sites in Trondheim were determined to be minimally aware of sea level extremes.

\section{Rewrite Abstract}

Improving the resilience of human settlements is required by UN SDG's 11 and 13. As a coastal country the resilience to sea level extremes is of high importance to Norway. Previous studies have focused on national or global level risk, however sea level extremes are extremely localized in Norway and the understanding of risk needs to be at a regional and local level. The purpose of this project is to determine resilience to sea level extremes in 4 key sites in Trondheim and assist the creation of a framework for quickly and cheaply determining a places resilience to changing sea level extremes. Projected resilience is considered as the projected outcome of the interplay of natural, technological and social systems. By working in the boundary of physical and human geography there is a hope of creating a more rounded view of Trondheim's resilience. Social systems of resilience are in many ways the most dynamic factor and as such are focused upon during this thesis. Surprisingly surveys conducted indicate better awareness of the risk of sea level extremes for the period 2050 to 2100 than 2022 to 2050. During the investigation of the link between local knowledge and academic models, residency was the most important factor affecting subjects awareness of sea level extremes.
