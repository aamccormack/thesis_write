\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Introduction to Project}
Coastal flooding due to extreme weather and sea level rise is increasing, because of the changing climate (\cite{hoffken_effects_2020}).  In other words, Sea Level Extremes (SLEs) are becoming more frequent, globally. The majority of Norwegian critical infrastructure and population is located within the coastal zone (\cite{engebakken_construction_2022}), and thus, more frequent SLEs will have significant impacts in Norway. A common narrative in Norway is that it is well-protected from the global sea-level rise caused by climate change. While the increase in area permanently inundated with water will be minimal within the next 70 years, there is likely to be an increase in extreme weather which will cause temporary SLEs (\cite{aunan_strong_2008}). The localised impacts of  SLE events requires greater focus. Previous models of changing SLEs were often conducted at too low a resolution, or were too simplistic to fully understand these changes (\cite{hoffken_effects_2020}). Due to newer models and more detailed mapping, the understanding of the impacts from potential SLEs is much clearer for the period 2022 to 2100. Whether this new information is aligned with local understanding of SLEs, impacts resilience to this risk (\cite{setten_we_2019}).  There is a need for localized understanding of this changing risk and how this changes the resilience of places (\cite{rod_integrated_2012}).

\section{thesisPurpose}
The overall purpose of this thesis is to determine the resilience to SLEs in four coastal neighbourhoods in Trondheim. However, resilience is dynamic and to truly understand it would require a framework of periodic analysis. This thesiswas developed to assist in the creation of such a framework, which could quickly and inexpensively determine a place's resilience to changing SLEs. Determining an overall understanding of a place's resilience requires connecting local knowledge with academic knowledge. Additionally, the method for determining resilience is designed to increase the awareness of the potential of SLEs in Trondheim. 

\section{thesisMotivation}
 This thesislies on the boundary between physical and human geography and attempts to minimise the gap between these views of the changing sea level in Trondheim. It also focuses on the interplay between local knowledge and more formalised knowledge such as academic and institutional knowledge. The academic knowledge is often either grounded in mathematical models of threats or theoretical underpinnings, rather than lived experienced of stakeholders. Furthermore, this knowledge has difficulty being utilised by policymakers. The motivation behind this thesisis the realisation of the importance of local knowledge in increasing resilience. This is combined with meeting individuals in areas of land uplift in the Nordics who have memory of how the sea levels have changed and have knowledge about the changing patterns of extreme sea levels in their places. This knowledge has been created from long term observation of places and appears underutilised by academia and planners alike, but could be helpful in the understanding of how areas will be impacted by the changing climate. 



\section{thesisObjectives}
The thesis objective is to determine Trondheim's resilience to SLEs by considering social, natural and technological systems. To do this, a survey was created to allow for determination of social systems of resilience.  Models of changing SLEs were used (\cite{kartverket_se_2020}), plus investigation of the coastline, to determine natural systems resilience. To determine technological systems resilience, planning permissions from the municipality for each of the research sites were reviewed and the impacts of coastal infrastructure on resilience were analysed.

\section{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How resilient will Trondheim be to SLEs during the period 2022 to 2050 and 2050 to 2100?
    \item Are Trondheim's coastal stakeholders aware of changes to SLEs?
    \item What factors impact  Trondheim's coastal stakeholdersâ€™ awareness of SLEs?
\end{enumerate}



\section{Hypotheses for Research Question 3}
Factors  impacting stakeholder awareness of SLEs were tested using non-parametric hypothesis testing with the Kruskal Wallis Rank Sum Test (\cite{hollander_nonparametric_2014}) where awareness is determined by the ability to correctly answer up to five questions about the changing sea levels in a specific place. Outlined below is the hypothesis of which factors awareness will be dependent upon. These were created prior to testing. The outcomes are detailed at the end of the results section. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is hypothesised that stakeholder awareness of SLEs will vary depending on community membership: we expect residents, commuters, marine workers and water leisure users to have higher determined awareness than non-marine workers and land leisure users.
  
    \item It is hypothesised that stakeholder awareness of SLEs will vary depending on local knowledge: we expect subjects with professional interest in SLEs,  primary knowledge about places on reclaimed land, length of knowledge of over 20 years, many information sources about the place and those who respond in Norwegian to have a higher determined awareness. We expect subjects who are new to the area (less than 1 year length of knowledge) to have a lower determined awareness.

    \item It is hypothesised that stakeholder awareness of SLEs will vary depending on their awareness of changing climate: we expect subjects who have access to information sources from formal education, for example, peer-reviewed publications, to have higher determined awareness. Additionally, we expect those who are more concerned about climate change or who predict they will be impacted by flooding from SLEs to have higher (?) determined awareness. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Approach}

This thesis has been developed using a mixed methodological approach of human and physical geography. The integration of these is essential to understanding resilience to a natural hazard. Concerns of labeling an area as not resilient or not aware were considered carefully before the start of this project.  It was deemed important that improving resilience and awareness needed to be the end goal. For this reason, this research creates a framework for measuring resilience. The ethics of how to improve resilience must also be considered. It was an active choice not to investigate demographics, such as gender, immigration status, age and physical ability, due to the ethical and political implications of making policy based on such results. While the highlighting of vulnerable populations and factors is important and often only identified after disasters (\cite{cutter_community_2020}), to declare these factors as undesirable based solely on their projected resilience to specific hazards is problematic. 

\paragraph{}
Factors affecting resilience which could be impacted by municipal planning or communications were prioritised. There is a need for a framework which can quickly and inexpensively provide an overview of the resilience for places in Norway, which can then be used to create adaptive strategies by policy makers (\cite{opach_seeking_2020}). There have been attempts to create vulnerability indices, but many of these include warnings that they should not be used to inform policy (\cite{opach_seeking_2020}).

\section{Thesis Structure}
The thesis is structured as follows: 
The following thesis is organised into eight chapters. The purpose of this chapter was to introduce the purpose of the thesisand the research questions.

In chapter two the background of the thesisis outlined including the research area and the specific sites. 

Chapter three outlines the methodology used including the data collection, data analysis and the limitations of the methodology.

Chapter four is the theory section which begins with defining the key terms and then goes on to explain the theories of resilience used during this project.

Chapter five is the results of the data collected and the results of the tests ran on this data, including the results of Kruskal Wallis Rank Sum Test. 

Chapter six is a discussion of the results presented in chapter five and included discussion of the research questions presented in the introduction. 

Chapter seven is a discussion of the Framework for Determining Resilience. The purpose of this thesiswas to assist the creation of such a framework and this section discusses the lessons learned including about conducting citizen science. It also includes suggestions for future research.

Finally chapter eight is the Conclusion section which summarises the results from each of the sections outlined here.

Chapter eight is followed by the appendix which is split into three sections. Section A includes the acronyms used throughout the thesis. Section B includes additional information which focuses on the visual aspects of communication, which were a key aspect of the design method for this project. Section C is a copy of the survey used in both English and Norwegian so when references are made to the survey design in the methodology and  discussion of framework a clearer idea of how subjects were presented with information and questions is available for interested parties. The surveys are also included to allow easy repetition of this project. This thesis can also be considered a guide to conducting this form of research in Trondheim.
