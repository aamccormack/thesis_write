\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Introduction to Project}
Coastal flooding due to extreme weather and sea level rise is increasing, because of the changing climate (\cite{hoffken_effects_2020}).  In other words, sea level extremes (SLEs) are becoming more frequent globally. The majority of Norwegian critical infrastructure and population falls within the coastal zone (\cite{engebakken_construction_2022}). This means that this change could have significant impacts. There is a narrative that Norway is protected from the global sea level rise caused by climate change. While the amount of area permanently inundated with water is minimal within the next 70 years, there is likely to be an increase in extreme weather which will cause temporary sea level extremes (\cite{aunan_strong_2008}). The localised impact of these sea level extremes requires greater focus. Previous models of changing sea level extremes were often conducted at too large a scale, or too simplistic to understand these changes (\cite{hoffken_effects_2020}). Due to newer models and better mapping, the picture of potential sea level extremes is much clearer between 2022 and 2100. Whether this new information is aligned with local understanding of sea level extremes impacts resilience to this risk (\cite{setten_we_2019}).  There is a need for localized understanding of this changing risk and how this changes the resilience of places (\cite{rod_integrated_2012}).

\section{Project Purpose}
The overall purpose of this project is to determine the resilience to sea level extremes in 4 key places in Trondheim. However, resilience is dynamic and to truly understand its changes would require a framework of periodic analysis. This project was created to assist the creation of such a framework, which could quickly and cheaply determine a place's resilience to changing sea level extremes. Determining an overall understanding of a place's resilience requires connecting local knowledge with academic knowledge. Additionally, the method for determining resilience is designed to increase the awareness of the potential of sea level extremes in Trondheim. 

\section{Project Motivation}
 This project lies on the boundary between physical and human geography and attempting to minimise the gap between these views on the changing sea level in Trondheim. The motivation behind this project is the realisation of the importance of local knowledge in increasing resilience. This is combined with meeting individuals in areas of land uplift in the Nordics who have memory of how the sea levels have changed and have knowledge about the changing patterns of extreme sea levels in their places. This knowledge has been created from long term observation of places and appeared underutilised by academia and planners alike, but could be helpful in the understanding of how areas will be impacted by the changing climate. 

\section{Project Objectives}
The project objective is to determine Trondheim's resilience to sea level extremes by considering social, natural and technological systems. To do this, a survey was created to allow for determination of social systems of resilience.  Models of changing sea level extremes were used (\cite{kartverket_se_2020}), plus investigation of the coastline, to determine natural systems resilience. To determine technological systems resilience, planning permission from the municipality for each of the research sites was analysed plus a consideration of how the infrastructure of the coastline impacts resilience.

\section{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How resilient will Trondheim be to sea level extremes during 2022 to 2050 and 2050 to 2100?
    \item Are stakeholders aware of changes to sea level extremes?
    \item What factors impact stakeholdersâ€™ awareness of sea level extremes ?
\end{enumerate}



\section{Hypothesis for Research Question 3}
Hypothesis testing  of which factors will impact stakeholders awareness of SLE'S was conducted using non-parametric hypothesis testing using the Kruskal Wallis Rank Sum Test (\cite{hollander_nonparametric_2014}). For this, awareness is determined by the ability to correctly answer five questions about the changing sea levels in a specific place. Outlined below is the hypothesis of which factors awareness will be dependent upon. These were created prior to testing. The outcomes are detailed at the end of the results section. 

\subsection{Hypothesis dependent on community membership}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We expect residents to be aware
    \item We expect commuters to be aware
    \item We expect marine workers to be aware
    \item We expect non-marine workers to be unaware
    \item We expect water leisure users to be aware
    \item We expect land leisure users to be unaware
    \end{enumerate}
\paragraph{}

\subsection{Hypothesis dependent on local knowledge}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We expect subjects with professional interest in SLEs to be aware
    \item We expect subjects with primary knowledge about places which are on reclaimed land to be aware
    \item We expect subjects with a length of knowledge greater than 20 years of the area to be aware
    \item We expect subjects with a length of knowledge less than 1 year of the area to be unaware
    \item We expect subjects with many information sources about the place to be aware
    \item We expect subjects who chose to respond in Norwegian to be aware
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{}

\subsection{Hypothesis dependent on awareness of changing climate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We expect subjects with many information sources about climate change to be aware
    \item We expect subjects with the information source of formal education to be aware
    \item We expect subjects with the information source of peer reviewed published papers to be aware
    \item We expect subjects who are more concerned about climate change to be aware
    \item We expect subjects who predict they will be impacted by flooding from SLEs to be aware
\end{enumerate}

\section{Approach}

The approach to this project was to create an overview of resilience. This was done by actively including approaches used in physical geography and human geography. The overlap of these is essential to understanding resilience to a natural hazard. Concerns of labeling an area as not resilient or not aware were considered carefully before the start of this project.  It was deemed important that improving resilience and awareness needed to be the end goal. For this reason, this research is framed as an attempt to assist the creation of a framework of measuring resilience. Furthermore, that the ethics of how to improve these factors needs to be considered. It was an active choice not to investigate demographics, such as gender, immigration status, age and physical ability, due to the ethical and political implications of making policy based on these types of results. While the highlighting of vulnerable populations and factors is important and often only identified after disasters (\cite{cutter_community_2020}), to declare these factors as undesirable based solely on their projected resilience to specific hazards is problematic. 

\paragraph{}
Factors affecting resilience which could be impacted by municipal planning or communications were focused upon. There is a need for a framework which can quickly and cheaply give an overview of the resilience for places in Norway which can be used to create adaptive strategies by policy makers (\cite{opach_seeking_2020}). There have been attempts to create vulnerability indices, but many of these include warnings that they should not be used to inform policymakers (\cite{opach_seeking_2020}).

\section{Structure of the Report}
The rest of the report is structured as follows. 
The following thesis is organised into eight chapters. The purpose of this chapter was to introduce the purpose of the project and the research questions.

In chapter two the background of the project is outlined including the research area and the specific sites. 

Chapter three outlines the methodology used including the data collection, data analysis and the limitations of the methodology.

Chapter four is the theory section which begins with defining the key terms and then goes on to explain the theories of resilience used during this project.

Chapter five is the results of the data collected and the results of the tests ran on this data. This is followed by chapter six which is a discussion of the results presented in chapter five. 


Chapter seven is a discussion of the Framework for Determining Resilience. The purpose of this project was to assist the creation of such a framework and this section discusses the lessons learned including about conducting citizen science. It also includes suggestions for future research

Finally chapter eight is the Conclusion section which summarises the results from each of the sections outlined here.

This chapter is followed by the appendix which is split into three sections. Section A is the acronyms used within this thesis. Section B is additional information which focuses on the visual aspects of communication which were a key aspect of the design method for this project. Section C is a copy of the survey used in both English and Norwegian so when references are made to the survey design in the methodology and  discussion of framework a clearer idea of how subjects were presented with information and questions is available for interested parties. The surveys are also included to allow easy repetition of this project. This thesis can also be considered a guide to conducting this form of research in Trondheim.
