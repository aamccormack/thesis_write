This research investigates knowledge about extreme sea levels in Trondheim, focusing on storm surges. A storm surge occurs when the weather temporarily causes water to be forced up and onto the coast.

A 20-year storm surge refers to the probability of an event, meaning there is a 1 in 20 chance (5%) of this level of event every year. This expectation changes over time, for example due to climate change.

What is your level of interest in sea level extremes?
\begin{itemize}
    \item professional interest
    \item high
    \item medium
    \item low
    \item low
    \item not interested
\end{itemize}

The following questions display simulated water levels extremes in Trondheim. The numbers in these images refer to the height above NN2000 which can be considered an approximation of mean sea level.
