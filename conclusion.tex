%%=========================================
%Here you give a summary of your your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary -- just explain what you have done and what you have found out. The Summary and Conclusions should be no more than two pages.

\section{Conclusions}
Sea level extremes are becoming more frequent globally. Trondheim just like Norway as a whole has large amounts of infrastructure and population resident within the coastal zone. To understand Trondheim's changing resilience to sea level extremes its technological, natural and social systems resilience was considered. Literature reviews, investigation of the coastline, analysis of city plans and planning permission was analysed to determine natural and technological system resilience. A survey was conducted to assist in the determination of social system resilience. Four places - Skansen, Grillstad, Bratt√∏ra and Nidelva were the research sites used to represent the cities resilience. They were chosen due to their higher physical vulnerability from SLEs and large daily throughput of all demographics.



To summarise this project determines Trondheim's projected resilience to SLEs during 2022-2050 as high and the projected resilience for 2050-2100 as very high. Stakeholders were deemed somewhat aware about changes to SLEs. The factors deemed to have impact on stakeholders' awareness of SLEs is whether they are residents, and whether they utilise the sources of family, newspapers and formal education for their information upon climate change. The method used to collect data on awareness was deemed appropriate. There is room for improvement in the data analysis technique of determining awareness. Neither subjects self-ranked interest level, nor the place they chose to respond upon were factors which were deemed to impact awareness.

Online surveys of self-selecting stakeholders was used to aid the determination of Trondheims social system resilience, particularly the key variable of awareness.
Whether this method of determining Trondheim's social system resilience to SLEs can also be used to improve awareness, hence improving resilience would be an interesting avenue for future research. 

Improving resilience is a requirement of the Sendai framework and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 13. This project has attempted to assist the creation of a framework to repeatedly measure resilience to see whether these goals are being met.
