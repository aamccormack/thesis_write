\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Conclusions}
Here you give a summary of your your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary -- just explain what you have done and what you have found out. The Summary and Conclusions should be no more than two pages.

\section{Future Research}
A lot of this is mentioned in the discusion.... do i need a seperate space??

COMPARE STAKEHOLDERS WORKSHOP TO SURVEY 
\cite{gerkensmeier_governing_2018} - GOT THE SAME RESULTS FROM WORKSHOP AND SURVEY - SURVEY IS EASIER TO COMPARE AND CHEAPER TO RERUN OVER THE YEARS, PERHAPS EVEN CHEAPER AS A ONE OFF

MULTI-RISK ANALYSYS OF RESILIENCE

ACTIVIELY INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WERE MISSED 

ABILITY TO EVEN QUICKER DETERMINE RESILIENCE -HMM AI , THINK THIS IS PROBABLY A BAD IDEA BUT SOMEONE WILL TRY - AI BAD AT LOTS OF DIFFERENT DATASETS WHICH THIS NEEDS, AI BAD A PRIORITINS WWHICH DATA IS OF GREATER VALUE/RELEVANCE WHICH DETERMINATIONS OF RESILIENCE NEED
