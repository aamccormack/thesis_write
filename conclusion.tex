%This is the Summary
%%=========================================
%Here you give a summary of your your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary -- just explain what you have done and what you have found out. The Summary and Conclusions should be no more than two pages.



\chapter{Conclusion}

Sea level extremes are becoming more frequent globally and as is discussed much of Trondheim's infrastructure and population is situated within the coastal zone, as is common in Norway. To understand Trondheim's changing resilience to sea level extremes, its technological, natural and social systems resilience were considered. Awareness is an important theme in this thesis falling under the broader concept of local knowledge. The conceptualisation of social system resilience, including the theme of local knowledge, chosen was a place-based understanding of community due to its dominance in Norwegian politics and general discussion. Projected resilience was viewed as a projected outcome, which is determined from systems allowing for the determination of projected resilience by analysing the systems which impact the risk. In this case social, natural and technological systems impacting the risk of sea level extremes. Thus far resilience research often focuses on highly vulnerable locations, hence working within the supposedly less vulnerable Trondheim can help create a reference point or target for a locations place-based resilience.

Literature reviews, investigation of the coastline, analysis of city plans and planning permissions were used to determine natural and technological systems resilience. Online surveys of self-selecting stakeholders were used to aid the determination of Trondheim's social system resilience, specifically investigating the key variable of awareness. This was designed following feedback from a focus group and pilot study carefully considering the framing of textual and visual communication, particularly the use of edited photographs to display likely future scenarios of sea level extremes in Trondheim.  Four places within Trondheim - Skansen, Grillstad, Bratt√∏ra and Nidelva - were selected to investigate the city's resilience. They were chosen due to their higher physical vulnerability to SLEs and large daily throughput of people which included a broad representation of society.

This thesis determines Trondheim's projected resilience to SLEs during 2022-2050 as high and the projected resilience for 2050-2100 as very high. This changing resilience is due to a large projected increase in technological system resilience while social system and natural systems have a slight reduction in projected resilience for this time period. Resilience is highly dynamic and of course over this time frame these results can change, hence monitoring to determine the trend in changing resilience is required.

Furthermore, stakeholders were deemed somewhat aware about changes to SLEs. The factors deemed to have impact on stakeholders' awareness of SLEs are whether they are residents, or whether they utilise the sources of family, newspapers and formal education for their information on climate change. This result enforces the the importance of framing the textual and visual communication for the designated audience as outlined in the communication design section of the methods as this can impact awareness and perception.  The method used to collect data on awareness was deemed appropriate. There is room for improvement in the data analysis technique of determining awareness. Neither subjects self-ranked interest level, nor the place they chose to respond upon, were factors which were deemed to impact awareness.

Whether the surveys utilising visual simulations of sea level extremes to determine Trondheim's social system resilience to SLEs can also be used to improve awareness, hence improving resilience, would be an interesting avenue for future research. As is the impact of including sectors of society who are often excluded from such research, but can be the most vulnerable including migrants, short term residents, youth and the immune compromised. Improving resilience is a requirement of the Sendai framework and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 13. This thesis has shown that carefully designed surveys may be a useful tool in a framework designed to repeatedly measure resilience to see whether these goals are being met.
