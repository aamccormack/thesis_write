Framskrivingene tar hensyn til landhevning og andre prosessor som påvirker havnivå lokalt. Stormflo oppstår når endringer i lufttrykk og vind endrer vannstanden betraktelig. Sammenfaller stormflo med en springperiode kan dette resultere i ekstra høy vannstand. En springperiode er en periode hvor tidevannet vil være høyere da krefter fra måne og sol virker i samme retninger rundt ny- og fullmåne. Målinger viser at globalt havnivå stiger. Dette skyldes i stor grad smeltevann fra ismassene og termisk ekspansjon av vann. Framskrivingene viser at store deler av norgeskysten vil oppleve en havnivåstigning i løpet av dette århundre til tross for landhevning. Se produktspesifikasjon for ytterligere informasjon.},

The paper has three main hypotheses: 1) showing that the basic needs hypothesized by {SDTand} those hypothesized by Place Attachment Literature are both affected by place features and have similar affective and behavioral outcomes; 2) showing that the ability of a place to satisfy individual’s needs is associated with the individual attachment to the place; 3) showing that the place attachment developed by the perception of needs satisfaction affects individual’s place-related behaviors.},

Constructing a vulnerability index raises several problems in the aggregation of these indicators, including the decision of assigning weights to them. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a method of aggregating vulnerability indicators that results in a composite index of vulnerability, but that avoids the problems associated with assigning weights. The investigators apply a technique based on Pareto ranking to a complex, developed socioeconomic landscape exposed to storm surges associated with hurricanes. Indicators of social vulnerability to this hazard are developed and a principal components analysis is performed on proxies for these indicators. Overall social vulnerability is calculated by applying Pareto ranking to these principal components. The paper concludes that it is possible to construct an effective index of vulnerability without weighting the individual vulnerability indicators.},

	abstract = {Assessments of ﬂood exposure and risk are usually conducted for individual events with a speciﬁc peak water level and hydrograph, without considering variations in the temporal evolution (duration and intensity) of storm surges. Here we investigate the inﬂuence of temporal variability of storm surge events on ﬂood characteristics in coastal zones, namely ﬂood extent and inundation depth, and assess the associated ﬂood exposure in terms of affected properties for the case of the municipality of Eckernförde, Germany. We use a nested hydrodynamic model to simulate ﬁve physically plausible, stochastically simulated storm surge events, with peak water levels corresponding to a univariate return period of 200 years and varying intensities. In a second step, the events are also combined with high-end sea-level rise projections corresponding to the {RCP} 8.5 scenario to analyze if the inﬂuence of temporal variability changes with rising sea-levels. Results show differences exceeding 5\% in ﬂood extent when comparing storm surges with the highest and lowest intensities. The number of properties exposed differs by approximately 20\%. Differences in mean and maximum inundation depths are approximately 5\%, both with and without sea-level rise. However, deviations in ﬂood extent increase by more than 20\%, depending on the sea-level rise projection, whereas differences in the number of exposed properties decrease. Our ﬁndings indicate that the temporal variability of storm surges can have considerable inﬂuence on ﬂood extent and exposure in the study area. Taking into account that ﬂood extent increases with rising sea-levels, we recommend that uncertainty related to the temporal variability of storm surges is represented in future ﬂood risk assessments to ensure efﬁcient planning and to provide a more comprehensive assessment of exposed infrastructure and assets.},

	abstract = {Current coastal spatial planning in Sweden uses simple methods to account for how ﬂood risks increase owing to sea level rise. Those methods, however, fail to account for several important aspects of sea level rise, such as: projection uncertainty, emission scenario uncertainty and time dependence. Here, enhanced methods that account for these uncertainties are applied at several locations along the coast. The relative importance of mean sea level rise and extreme events for ﬂood risk is explored for different timeframes. A general conclusion for all locations is that, extreme events dominate the ﬂood risk for planning periods lasting a few decades. For longer planning periods, lasting toward the end of the century, the ﬂood risk is instead dominated by the risk of high sea level rise. It is argued that these ﬁndings are important for assessments of future ﬂood risk, and that they should be reﬂected in coastal spatial planning.},

The authors used a set of socioeconomic and environmental indicators as measures of municipalities’ resilience and performed a cluster analysis to divide the municipalities into groups with similar multivariate resilience signatures. The results revealed six groups of municipalities that, apart from their unique combinations of indicator scores, featured certain spatial patterns, such as an “urban cluster” with urbanized municipalities and a “suburban cluster” with municipalities concentrated around major cities. The authors conclude that municipalities in each of the groups shared aspects that made them either more or less resilient to natural hazards, which could make them potential targets for shared interventions. Additionally, the authors conclude that clustering can be used to identify municipalities with similar resilience features and that could beneﬁt from networking and sharing operational planning as a way to improve their respective communities’ resilience to natural hazards.},

In the article, the authors examine how survey participants’ personal experiences of extreme events and climate-related changes in the natural environment inﬂuenced their perceptions of climate change. Using data from a nationally representative survey conducted in Norway in 2015 and the results of logistic regressions, the authors ﬁnd that individual observations of changes in nature were linked to higher levels of concern with regard to climate change, as well as to attitudes that were more positive towards personal mitigation and adaption eﬀorts. Somewhat counter-intuitively, they also ﬁnd that participants who had personally experienced a natural hazard event were less concerned about climate change compared with participants without such experiences. The authors conclude that personal experience of the consequences of climate change may in some cases have a limited eﬀect on enhancing people’s concerns about climate change.},

Thus far, we have mapped ∼ 80 \% of the coast, for which we currently have data of sufﬁcient accuracy to perform our analysis. Although Norway is generally at low risk from sea level rise largely owing to its steep topography and land uplift due to glacial isostatic adjustment, the maps presented here show that, on local scales, many parts of the coast are potentially vulnerable to ﬂooding. There is a considerable amount of infrastructure at risk along the relatively long and complicated coastline. Nationwide we identify a total area of 400 km2, 105 000 buildings, and 510 km of roads that are at risk of ﬂooding from a 200-year storm surge event at present. These numbers will increase to 610 km2, 137 000, and 1340 km with projected sea level rise to 2090 (95th percentile of {RCP}8.5 as recommended in planning). We ﬁnd that some of our results are likely biased high owing to erroneous mapping (at least for lower water levels close to the tidal datum which delineates the coastline). A comparison of control points from different terrain types indicates that the elevation model has a root-mean-square error of 0.26 m and is the largest source of uncertainty in our mapping method. The coastal ﬂooding maps and associated statistics are freely available, and alongside the development of coastal climate services, will help communicate the risks of sea level rise and storm surge to stakeholders. This will in turn aid coastal management and climate adaptation work in Norway.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the concept of adaptation of human communities to global changes, especially climate change, in the context of adaptive capacity and vulnerability. It focuses on scholarship that contributes to practical implementation of adaptations at the community scale. In numerous social science ﬁelds, adaptations are considered as responses to risks associated with the interaction of environmental hazards and human vulnerability or adaptive capacity. In the climate change ﬁeld, adaptation analyses have been undertaken for several distinct purposes. Impact assessments assume adaptations to estimate damages to longer term climate scenarios with and without adjustments. Evaluations of speciﬁed adaptation options aim to identify preferred measures. Vulnerability indices seek to provide relative vulnerability scores for countries, regions or communities. The main purpose of participatory vulnerability assessments is to identify adaptation strategies that are feasible and practical in communities. The distinctive features of adaptation analyses with this purpose are outlined, and common elements of this approach are described. Practical adaptation initiatives tend to focus on risks that are already problematic, climate is considered together with other environmental and social stresses, and adaptations are mostly integrated or mainstreamed into other resource management, disaster preparedness and sustainable development programs. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we chal­ lenge this assumption by focusing on the memory of disaster as key aspect through which it is possible to go beyond the “there and then” of a disaster. By applying the concept of memory anchoring, we illustrate the importance of memory for its repercussions on the present “here and now” as well as on the future way of dealing with disasters. We apply the framework of memory anchors to the case study of the Storm Surge 1962 and the following flood disaster, which took place in Hamburg, Germany and marked a turning point in Hamburg’s disaster history. This disaster is locally constructed as memory anchor by those who directly experienced it, and those who have to deal with natural hazards in the city’s administration. We scrutinize how different actors enact the memory anchoring process and with what aims. The process of memory anchoring is reflected in locational and societal representations and therefore supports the imaginaries of space and time of the disaster. However, which role can memory anchors play in future disaster awareness and management? Which role do they play in policy decisions on flood management? And how can memory anchors impact future generations in their dealing with disasters? The question remains on how (and if) it is possible to prevent disappearance of memory anchors without the need of a further disaster.},

One key consideration is the underlying notion of dynamic change or transformation in the systems that aﬀect community resilience—social systems, natural systems, technological systems—and the degree to which the interdependencies inﬂuence who is resilient, to what, where, and to whom. The article examines community resilience from the broad perspective of aﬄuent societies and illustrates the considerable variability in both the temporal and spatial nature of community resilience to natural hazards in the short term, and climate changes in the longer term, especially in more aﬄuent societies. The author ﬁnds that, given the rapidity of environmental, social, economic, political, technological, and cultural changes, present circumstances and remedies may not be adequate predictors or precursors of future conditions. She concludes that the challenges associated with community resilience, natural hazards, and climate change require transformational thinking and action if achievements are to be made in terms of signiﬁcant disaster risk reduction and any semblance of a sustainable future when extreme weather events will be the norm, not the exception.},
